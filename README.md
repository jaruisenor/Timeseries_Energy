# Timeseries_Energy
This project is about making a series of forecast over an Energy consumption dataset in the USA. The dataset was obtained from kaggle selecting Energy_PJM.csv, PJME_hourly.csv and PJMW_hourly.csv. The 3 parts of the project where made with the objective of familiarizing with some time series prediction algorythms. 

## Objectives
The repository considers 2 full analysis of the use of Facebook Prophet for timeseries prediction and modelling, as well as the use of ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving averages) model in order to succesfully predict energy consumption timeseries data.

The next step in the project, is the completion of the prediction of timeseries data using deeplearning techniques. The project is in stand by, further knowledge of Deep Learning tehcniques for timeseries, such as recurrent neural networks and convolutional architecures, needed to be gained in order to fully understand the alogrythm. Further work on this dtaset will be continued reformulating data wrangling methods (better order of the data) and succesful predictions using RNN.
